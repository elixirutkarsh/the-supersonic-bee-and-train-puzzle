Problem Statement:
A bee is flying at a constant speed of X kilometers per hour. At the same time, a train is traveling along the same straight track at a constant speed of Y kilometers per hour. The train initially starts at point A, and the bee starts at point B, which is some distance away. The bee flies towards the train, reaches it, and then immediately turns around and heads back to point B. The bee continues to fly back and forth between the train and point B until the train reaches point B. What is the total distance that the bee has flown?

Solution:
To solve this puzzle, let's assume that the distance between point A (starting point of the train) and point B (starting point of the bee) is D kilometers.

Time taken for the train to reach point B: Since the train travels at a constant speed of Y kilometers per hour, it would take D / Y hours for the train to reach point B.

During this time, the bee is flying towards the train at a speed of X kilometers per hour. So, in the time it takes for the train to reach point B, the bee would have flown a distance of (D / Y) * X kilometers towards the train.

Now, the bee turns around and flies back towards point B. The distance between the bee and the train decreases at the combined speed of X + Y kilometers per hour (relative speed of the bee with respect to the train).

As the train and the bee are getting closer at a relative speed of (X + Y) kilometers per hour, it would take (D / (X + Y)) hours for them to meet.

In this time, the bee would have flown a distance of (D / (X + Y)) * X kilometers towards the train.

The bee continues to fly back and forth between the train and point B until the train reaches point B. Each time, the bee covers a distance of (D / Y) * X kilometers towards the train.

Since the train takes D / Y hours to reach point B, the number of times the bee flies towards the train is (D / Y).

Therefore, the total distance covered by the bee is [(D / Y) * X] + [(D / (X + Y)) * X] + [(D / Y) * X].
